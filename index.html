            <p>By the end of this piece, we strive to shine a light on what traits that hold us or others back. You will
                think of specific people and specific events when you have encountered inferior men or women in your
                life.

            <h1>DREAM BIG</h1>
            <h2>Want to be a web-developer</h2>
            <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.
