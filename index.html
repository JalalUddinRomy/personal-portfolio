            <p>By the end of this piece, we strive to shine a light on what traits that hold us or others back. You will
                think of specific people and specific events when you have encountered inferior men or women in your
                life.

            <h1>DREAM BIG</h1>
            <h2>Want to be a web-developer</h2>
            <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.

                <P>It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first
                    computer
                    I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my
                    grandma
                    would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the
                    functionality
                    of which, unfortunately, was very limited
